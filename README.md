Simple tool to download Public Domain books from https://runeberg.org
and produce reasonably readable epub files. Works for some books that
I've tried it on.

For ease of installing using `go install
github.com/quite/runepub/cmd/runepub@latest`, this repository contains
(possibly outdated) copies of the files
`https://runeberg.org/authors/{a,t}.lst`.
